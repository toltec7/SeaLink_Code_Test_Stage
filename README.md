# SeaLink_Code_Test_Stage
Code test for the UI/UX Designer and Web Developer Position at Sealink

Thank you for applying for the UI/UX Designer and Web Developer Position

As part of the recruitment process we are asking potential candidates to carry out a small code test before we proceed to interview stage. If you make it through to the initial interview stage there’ll be an opportunity to spend a half day with the team. SeaLink would pay for your time at the pro-rated salaried rate for the position. It’s as much an opportunity for you to discover what we do at SeaLink as it is for us to learn about you. 

As mentioned, before we move to interview stage we have a small code test:

Steps to Complete. 

1. Follow this link to a GIST: https://gist.github.com/firecall/6ba366002f891f66ad28

2. Take the HTML4 code snippet in the GIST and refactor it into a modern full HTML5 document with associated CSS/JS.

3. Focus on good coding standards and document structure. We like nice design, but that’s not the main objective.

4. Submit the completed project to a free public Github repository

5. Email the link to the completed repository to alex.counsell@sealink.com.au

We don’t expect this task to take more than a couple of hours.

This is an open question and up to you to decide how you complete it. You may use CSS/JS frameworks such as Bootstrap, jQuery or similar but we’d really like to see you show off your own coding capabilities and ability to make a page from scratch. 

Once we’ve reviewed your completed submission we’ll let you know if you’ve made it through to interview stage. 

Good luck!

Alex
